This is a very brief example of how to build UIs with Replicant and Datascript
based state management.

The [core namespace](./src/state_datascript/core.cljs) wires up a mini-framework
where you can implement actions. The [ui
namespace](./src/state_datascript/ui.cljc) contains pure functions to render the
UI.

The development build is initialized from [the dev
namespace](./dev/state_datascript/dev.cljs). There is also a [prod
namespace](./src/state_datascript/prod.cljs) which could be used as the target
for a production build.

There is a router setup here as well. Check out the [state-setup
branch](https://github.com/cjohansen/replicant-state-datascript/tree/state-setup)
for the version that only has state management.
